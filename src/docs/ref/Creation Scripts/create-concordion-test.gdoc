h1. create-concordion-test

h2. Purpose

Create a new sample specification, consisting of an HTML file and its companion Groovy fixture test,
that you can use as an starting point to modify and create your own specification.

h2. Description

The script creates a sample Concordion-based specification under the @test/concordion@ directory, 
which you can use as an starting point template to modify and build your own tests. 
As result of this command, if you inspect the @test/concordion/<package>@ directory you will find 
the following two files:

* @<SpecificationName>.html@: an HTML file containing the sample specification.
* @<SpecificationName>Test.groovy@: the fixture test Groovy class for this specification.

If the @geb@ option is specified, then the script generate a simple sample for a web specification 
based on the Geb framework (a browser automation solution for the Groovy language). 
You may prefer this option when you want to write specs about your web interfaces.

If the specification name specified already exists in your project, 
then the script will prompt yoy if you want to overwrite the specification's files or not.

Usage:
{code:java}
grails create-concordion-test [-web] specificationName
{code}

Required arguments:

* @specificationName@ - The name of the specification to create (you can also specify a package name)

Optional arguments:

* @web@ - if specified the sample specification generated will be a Geb-based one.

{note}
Note that to run Geb-based specifications you have to declared the following test dependencies
in the project's @BuildConfig.groovy@:
{code}
    dependencies {
        ...
	test("org.codehaus.geb:geb-core:latest.release")
	test("org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-firefox-driver:2.0a7")
    }
{code}
