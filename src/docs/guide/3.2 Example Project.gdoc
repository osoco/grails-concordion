We are creating an example project based on the 
[Grails Pomodoro|http://github.com/grails-samples/grails-pomodoro] application to test the plugin and
provide examples of web-based acceptance tests for a little Grails application. 

The example project @grails-pomodoro-concordion@ is not bundled in the plugin itself and it is still
a work in progress, but you can found it at 
[OSOCO's GitHub repository|http://github.com/osoco/grails-pomodoro-concordion].
