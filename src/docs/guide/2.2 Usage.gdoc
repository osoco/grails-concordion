h4. Create specifications

The first step will be to create some specifications (or acceptance tests) in the @test/concordion@
directory. You can create them manually or create a template using the @create-concordion-test@ script.
For instance, you can execute the command:

{code}
grails create-concordion-test org.example.SimpleSpec
{code}

This will generate a very simple template for an acceptance test, consisting on the specification file 
@SimpleSpec.html@ and a fixture class @SimpleSpecTest.groovy@. Both files will be generated under the
@test/concordion/org/example@ directory that the command will create if it does not exist.

h4. Run specifications

Once you have one or more Concordion specs, you can run them using the new phase test concordion in
the following way:

{code}
grails test-app concordion:
{code}

Running this command will start up the Grails application (this way your specifications can test the
web interface), launch all the Concordion specifications and return the results.

By default all tests are executed, but you can specify the names of the tests (without the "Tests" or other test type suffix) as argument to the command.

Beside the usual test reports generated at @target/test-reports/TESTS-TestSuites.xml@, @target/test-reports/plain@ and @target/test-reports/html@, the Concordion tests will generate highly readable reports located
at @target/test-reports/concordion@.
