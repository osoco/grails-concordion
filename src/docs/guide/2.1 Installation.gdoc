You can install the plugin as usual in Grails:

{code}
grails install-plugin concordion
{code}

The plugin will download some dependencies like Concordion, 
Concordion Extensions and some Selenium libraries required by these extensions.

If the directory @test/concordion@ is missing in your project, the plugin will 
create it when is installed.
